DAY-1

Depose = Development (plan,code,test,bild) + operations (release,deploy,monitor,operate)

->Collaboration between development and operation teams
->Automation of software delivery processes
->Continuous interaction (ci) and continuous Delivery(cd)
-> import quality and speed

=>continous integration
   ->Automatically build and test when there is change in code
   -> ensure the bug free code
   -> ensure hidher code quality and reduces integration issues
   ->packaging the application (war/jar/docker image)


=>continous deployment
->automatically deploy for production


life cycle:
------------

code-->build-->test-->deployment

tools:
------
code   --  git,github,gitlab,bitbucket
build  --  war/jar/docker image
test   --  pytest,junit test,SonarQube
Deploy --  apache/tomcat,docker,kubernetes


GIT:
----
->its a version control source code repository 


SOUCE CODE OD CICD-report IN GIT:
-------------------------------------

echo "# CICD-report-" >> README.md

git init                                       #initialize a new git repository  in the current directory

git add README.md                              #Stage all the files to the committed

git commit -m "first commit"                   #commit the staged files with the message"first commit"

git branch -M main                             # Rename the current branch to 'main' (forcefully,if necessary)

git remote add origin https://github.com/ShaikMohammedSameer3903/CICD-report-.git     #Link the local repository to the remote repository

git push -u origin main                        #Push the main branch to github
